## N0 — harness diagnosis, error triage, family classification, ratchet scaffold

### mechanism 0 (pre-fix, harness-level): the stated baseline measured the WRONG pipeline
- Mechanism: `scripts/svg-conformance-census.ts`'s `renderFixture` (now
  `renderFixtureDescription`) was hardcoded to `parseDescription` ->
  `layoutDescription` -> `renderDescription` and was called unconditionally
  for EVERY fixture type, including `class`, despite the script accepting a
  `class` CLI type arg (which only ever fed `listFixtureDirs('class')` — the
  fixture-discovery step, not the render step). `parseDescription` does not
  throw on class markup — it silently ignores syntax it doesn't recognize.
  Jar-verified with `test-results/dot-cache/class/bajotu-30-soku184/in.puml`
  (`package p1 { class cl1 } class cl2 p1 --> cl2`):
  `parseDescription` produces an AST with 2 nodes (`p1` as a `package`
  group, `cl2` misclassified as symbol `interface`) and **`cl1` entirely
  absent** — nested native class syntax inside a `package{}` block has no
  meaning to the description grammar. The README's stated baseline
  (`0/718, 1-3:2, 4-10:548, 11-30:53, 31+:84, errors:31`) was computed
  against this wrong-engine output; every fixture's diff count reflected how
  close a WRONG diagram happened to land to the jar's real one, not any
  class-engine conformance signal.
- Disposition: fixed at the harness level (not a src/ semantic change) —
  new `tests/oracle/svg-conformance/render-fixture-class.ts#renderFixtureClass`
  (mirrors `render-fixture.ts` exactly, but calls `parseClass` ->
  `layoutClass` -> `renderClass`; `renderClass(geo, theme)` takes no
  `measurer` of its own, unlike `renderDescription`, since every text metric
  is already baked into `ClassGeometry` by `layoutClass`). `svg-conformance-
  census.ts` gained a `renderFixtureFor(type, markup, measurer)` dispatcher:
  `class` -> `renderFixtureClass`, everything else -> the pre-existing
  `renderFixtureDescription` (unchanged, so the description SVG gate is
  provably untouched by this file). Re-measuring against the CORRECT
  pipeline gives an entirely different profile — see "N0 corrected
  baseline" below. This is the number the rest of N0's triage/family work
  is built on, not the README's stated one.
- Slugs: all 718 (harness-level, not fixture-specific).

### N0 corrected baseline (after mechanism 0's fix, before the stdlib-store fix)
```
0/718 conformant · 1-3: 0 · 4-10: 548→19 · 11-30: 53→695 · 31+: 84→0 · errors: 31→4
```
Bucket shape inverted entirely: dominated by `11-30` now (real per-fixture
diff counts cluster around 10-13, root-shell-family-sized), not `4-10`
(an artifact of the wrong engine's coincidental near-misses). `errors` also
dropped from 31 to 4 — `parseDescription`'s silent-success-with-garbage-
output behavior was itself masking some of what would have been `class`-
engine errors as low-but-nonzero diff counts instead of throws.

### mechanism 1 (harness-level): class render path had no stdlib `IncludeStore` wired — FIXED
- Mechanism: all 4 post-mechanism-0 errors were `StdlibNotBundledError`
  (`bidusa-22-jutu505`, `cuzoga-39-tufu259`, `jevuvi-65-dipo437`,
  `ruliki-78-biji661`, each `!include <tupadr3/...>`). `renderFixtureClass`
  called `buildBlockUmls(markup)` with no options, so `!include`
  resolution had no store at all. `svg-conformance-census.ts`'s OWN
  description path already solves this exact problem via a module-level
  `censusIncludeStore()` (`withStdlib(..., buildStdlibAssetsStore())`,
  SI5b/T9 precedent) passed as `{ includeStore }` to `buildBlockUmls`.
- Disposition: fixed — `renderFixtureClass` gained an additive, optional
  third parameter (`options?: PreprocessOptions`, passed straight through
  to `buildBlockUmls`); `renderFixtureFor`'s class branch now passes
  `{ includeStore: censusIncludeStore() }`. Zero src/ files touched.
  Census errors: 4 -> 0.
- Slugs: bidusa-22-jutu505, cuzoga-39-tufu259, jevuvi-65-dipo437,
  ruliki-78-biji661 (all 4, now render/compare cleanly — not zero-diff,
  just no longer crashing; see the family table for their measured diffs).

### N0 final corrected baseline (after both harness fixes)
```
0/718 conformant · 1-3: 0 · 4-10: 19 · 11-30: 699 · 31+: 0 · errors: 0
```
Every fixture renders and compares cleanly — no crashes, no malformed-jar-
SVG cases in the class corpus (unlike description's one permanently-
ledgered 3-dash-comment jar quirk, I0). This is the number for the family
table below and the number the README/status line should carry forward.

### family table (`--families`, 718/718 fixtures, 0 errors)
| fixtures | diffs | family | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 718 (100%) | 718 | `svg/@contentStyleType` | pure literal-string gap |
| 718 (100%) | 718 | `svg/@preserveAspectRatio` | pure literal-string gap |
| 718 (100%) | 718 | `svg/@version` | pure literal-string gap |
| 718 (100%) | 1430 | `svg/@viewBox` | 2 components/fixture (width+height) — entangled with the width/height family below, NOT a pure shell gap |
| 718 (100%) | 718 | `svg/@xmlns:xlink` | pure literal-string gap |
| 718 (100%) | 718 | `svg/@zoomAndPan` | pure literal-string gap |
| 717 (99.9%) | 717 | `svg/@height` | real layout/geometry divergence (see below) |
| 715 (99.6%) | 715 | `svg[childCount]` | structural: flat children vs jar's single wrapping `<g>` |
| 713 (99.3%) | 713 | `svg/@width` | real layout/geometry divergence |
| 702 (97.8%) | 702 | `svg/@background` | pure literal-string gap (derived from jar's `style="...background:#FFFFFF;"`, see mechanism below) |
| 3 (0.4%) | 3 | `svg/defs[childCount]` | too small to classify this iteration; likely entangled with the marker-vs-inline-polygon divergence below, unreachable from most fixtures because compareSvg stops recursing once the PARENT `svg[childCount]` already mismatches |
| 3 (0.4%) | 3 | `svg/g[childCount]` | same caveat as above |

### mechanism 2: "SVG root shell" — universal, NOT fixed this iteration (N1 target)
- Mechanism, part A (pure constants): `src/core/svg.ts#svgRoot` (the
  generic `RenderFragment` assembler used by every non-klimt engine,
  `src/index.ts:147`) emits only `xmlns width height viewBox` on the root
  `<svg>` — no `xmlns:xlink`, `version`, `zoomAndPan`, `preserveAspectRatio`,
  `contentStyleType`, and no `background` (jar bakes background into a
  `style="...background:<color>;"` declaration; `tests/oracle/svg-
  conformance/normalize.ts`'s adaptation #1 resolves `style` declarations
  into individual attributes before comparison, so a bare
  `background="<color>"` XML attribute on our side would satisfy the
  comparator just as well — verified by reading `normalize.ts:97-165`, no
  actual `style=` juggling required). This is the SAME class of gap G1's I1
  diagnosed for description's ANNOTATED path (`plans/g1-description-svg/
  ledger.md` I1, "`unwrapKlimtSvg`/`svgRoot` discards klimt's own document
  shell") — but description's fix (`assembleKlimtShell`) deliberately left
  `svgRoot` itself untouched ("`svgRoot` itself and every other engine's
  assembly path are untouched" — I1's own disposition text). Every OTHER
  `svgRoot` consumer (class, object, state, json, dot, sequence, activity,
  chart, board, chronology, files, hcl, packetdiag, yaml,
  `error-renderer.ts`) still carries this exact gap, unaudited by this
  mission.
- Mechanism, part B (structural, NOT a constant): jar's class SVG root has
  exactly 2 children — `<defs/>` (empty, self-closing) and ONE `<g>`
  wrapping the entire diagram body (clusters, classifiers, edges, notes).
  `svgRoot` instead emits `children.join('')` as flat siblings alongside
  its own `defs` block and an optional background `<rect>` — 16 top-level
  children on the sample fixture vs jar's 2. Compounding this: `svgRoot`
  unconditionally injects `<marker>` defs for `ALL_ARROW_TYPES`
  (`src/core/svg.ts`, per CLAUDE.md's own note that this is
  "embed[ded]...automatically"), but jar's class SVGs contain **zero**
  `<marker>`/`markerEnd` anywhere in the sampled corpus (grep-verified on
  `bajotu-30-soku184/in.svg`: 0 `<marker`, 0 `marker-end=`/`markerEnd=`,
  1 literal `<polygon>`) — jar draws class-diagram arrowheads (extension/
  dependency/composition/aggregation) as inline `<polygon>`/`<path>` shapes
  at each edge endpoint, the SAME architectural choice description's engine
  already made (per description's own doc comments on inline polygon
  arrowheads). `src/diagrams/class/renderer.ts` instead uses
  `arrowHeadRef(...)` + `markerEnd` (SVG-native `<marker>` references,
  lines ~230-267) — a genuine, additional structural divergence from
  upstream's rendering architecture, not just a missing-attribute gap.
- Evidence this is ONE blocking mechanism, not several independent small
  ones: inspected all 19 fixtures in the census's `4-10` bucket (the
  closest-to-conformant tier) — EVERY one of them carries EXACTLY the
  literal-constant attrs (5-6, depending on whether `background` already
  happens to match) plus `svg[childCount]` and nothing else; the 6
  fixtures at diff-count 9 are missing only ONE of width/height (their
  jar dimensions happen to already match ours on one axis); the 13 at
  diff-count 10 carry both width+height+viewBox[2]+viewBox[3] on top.
  **Zero fixtures reach diff-count < 9; zero fixtures are blocked by
  `svg[childCount]` alone with the constants already fixed** — meaning a
  constants-only fix (part A) would not bring ANY fixture in this census to
  zero-diff; part B (structural wrap + marker/inline-polygon reconciliation)
  must land in the SAME iteration for the ratchet to gain its first slug.
- Disposition: NOT fixed this iteration. Per the mission's own guidance
  ("you may drill and fix the single largest [mechanism] IF it is a genuine
  quick fix (a constant, a format string) — otherwise this iteration is
  measurement + harness") and G1's own precedent (I1's structurally
  identical klimt-shell gap was its own dedicated iteration, explicitly NOT
  bundled into I0's triage pass), this is ledgered as **N1's target**, not
  attempted here. It requires: (1) a design decision on where the fix lives
  — a new class-specific shell function mirroring `assembleKlimtShell`
  (narrower blast radius, matches the I1 precedent exactly) vs. changing
  the shared `svgRoot` (touches ~13 other diagram engines, none audited by
  this mission, real regression risk); (2) reconciling the marker-vs-
  inline-polygon architecture choice for class edges (a rendering-code
  change, not a shell-assembly change — likely its OWN sub-mechanism inside
  N1, since it affects `<defs>` content and edge-drawing, not just the root
  tag); (3) new tests (unit + the census's own `--families` re-run as a
  release check), TDD per `testing.md`.
- Slugs: reach not enumerated per-fixture (698-718/718 depending on the
  specific sub-attribute); the 19 `4-10`-bucket fixtures are the highest-
  value first targets for N1's zero-diff proof: cojixe-63-vejo525,
  fibamu-81-zimo884, ririlu-13-zipi740, sipimu-09-joma900,
  vokati-75-gude769, zijupe-74-sake513 (diff-count 9, missing only ONE of
  width/height); bedogi-86-kala547, ganika-12-pane511, gopalo-51-leje047,
  jinibe-02-tebi269, lilura-67-cati343, menejo-70-tazo448,
  mizupo-59-zala765, mucuxi-36-beku683, remulu-24-zadi546,
  rizufo-14-dadi153, siluti-87-sefa007, vukonu-92-coto378,
  xosupo-71-jeso490 (diff-count 10, missing both).

### svg[childCount]/defs[childCount] small residuals — not separately investigated
- Mechanism: 3/718 fixtures show a SEPARATE `svg/defs[childCount]` and/or
  `svg/g[childCount]` diff not explained by mechanism 2 alone (or possibly
  a downstream consequence of it, unreachable for analysis until mechanism
  2's `svg[childCount]` blocker clears — `compareSvg`'s tree-walk does not
  recurse into children once a parent's child COUNT already mismatches, so
  these 3 fixtures' deeper shape cannot be diagnosed accurately until N1's
  fix lands and re-exposes them).
- Disposition: not investigated this iteration — too small a reach (0.4%)
  to prioritize over mechanism 2, and not independently diagnosable while
  mechanism 2 is unfixed.
- Slugs: not identified individually this iteration (would require a
  fixture-level rerun once mechanism 2 clears).

## Ratchet harness deliverables (N0)
- `oracle/goldens/svg-class/ratchet.json` — empty manifest (`fixtures: []`).
- `oracle/goldens/svg-class/README.md` — mirrors `svg-description/README.md`
  structure; documents the current empty state and cites this ledger entry.
- `tests/oracle/svg-conformance/render-fixture-class.ts` — class-pipeline
  render helper (`renderFixtureClass`), the harness deliverable underlying
  BOTH the ratchet test and the corrected census dispatch.
- `tests/oracle/svg-conformance/class.golden.ratchet.test.ts` — AC1/AC2/AC3,
  all three gracefully degrading to a placeholder assertion while
  `ratchet.json`/`parity-class.json` are empty (see decision-journal.md).
- `tests/oracle/svg-conformance/parity-class.json` — unsurveyed placeholder
  (`{ generatedAt: "unsurveyed", fixtures: [] }`); `scripts/svg-parity-
  survey.ts` gained additive `--out <path>` + positional-type-args support
  (default behavior unchanged — verified no `component`/`usecase`
  `parity.json` regeneration occurred this iteration) so a future
  `--out tests/oracle/svg-conformance/parity-class.json class` run can
  populate it once N1 produces real zero-diff candidates.
- `scripts/svg-conformance-census.ts` — `renderFixtureFor` dispatcher (class
  -> `renderFixtureClass` w/ stdlib store; else -> the untouched, pre-
  existing `renderFixtureDescription`).
